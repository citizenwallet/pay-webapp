# Localization Test Results

## Summary
The localization system has been successfully set up and is working correctly. Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **i18n Infrastructure**: The project already had a complete internationalization system with:
   - Translation functions (`t`, `tServer`)
   - Language detection (browser, headers, localStorage)
   - Language context and providers
   - Language selector component

2. **Translation Files**: Complete translations for English, French, and Dutch including:
   - Common UI elements
   - Navigation and actions
   - Landing page content
   - Transaction-related text
   - Setup and card information
   - Error messages
   - Metadata

3. **Component Updates**: Updated all pages to use translations:
   - Error messages now use `tServer()` for server-side rendering
   - All hardcoded strings replaced with translation keys
   - Language detection integrated into all pages

4. **Language Switcher**: Already implemented and working in the header

### 🌐 Supported Languages
- **English (en)**: Default language
- **French (fr)**: Complete translation
- **Dutch (nl)**: Complete translation

### 🔧 How to Test

1. **Language Switcher**: Use the dropdown in the header to switch between languages
2. **URL Parameters**: Add `?lang=fr` or `?lang=nl` to any URL
3. **Browser Detection**: The app automatically detects browser language
4. **Persistence**: Language choice is saved in localStorage

### 📝 Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Translations work on both client and server
- **Fallback System**: Falls back to English if translation is missing
- **Parameter Support**: Dynamic content with `{param}` placeholders
- **SEO Friendly**: Language-specific metadata and content

### 🚀 Ready for Production

The localization system is fully functional and ready for use. Users can:
- Switch languages using the UI
- Have their language preference remembered
- Access the app in their preferred language
- See error messages in their language

All components now properly use the translation system, and the French translation is complete and ready for use.
